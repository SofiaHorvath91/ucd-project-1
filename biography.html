              Salvador Dalí was a prominent Spanish surrealist painter born in Figueres, Catalonia, on 11 May 1904,
              to a prosperous middle-class family. Dali's father was strict in the education of his children unlike the
              mother,
              but they both greatly nurtured his early interest in art.
              Dali had a brother named Salvador who was born nine months before him and died of gastroenteritis.
              When he was five, Dalí was taken to his brother's grave and was told that he was his brother's
              reincarnation
              - an idea that surely planted various ideas in the impressionable child.
            </p>
            <p>
              At an early age, Salvador Dali's parents encouraged him to produce highly sophisticated drawings and was
              sent
              to drawing school in Figueres, Spain, in 1916. In February 1921, Dalí's mother died of breast cancer.
              Dalí was 16 years old; he later said his mother's death was the greatest blow he had experienced in his
              life.
              After her death, Dalí's father married his deceased wife's sister.
              Dalí did not resent this marriage, because he had a great love and respect for his aunt.

              In 1922, Dalí moved to Madrid and studied at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando where he
              already drew attention as
              an eccentric and dandy. He fell in with, and became close to, a group of leading artistic personalities
              that included filmmaker
              Luis Buñuel and poet Federico García Lorca, who exposed him to the most important minds of the time such
              as Le Corbusier, Einstein,
              Calder and Stravinsky. He was influenced by several different artistic styles, including Metaphysics and
              Cubism.
              Dalí was expelled from the Academy in 1926, shortly before his final exams when he was accused of starting
              an unrest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, Dali visited Paris where he met Pablo Picasso whom he revered. He began studying the psychoanalytic
              concepts of Freud as well
              as metaphysical painters like Giorgio de Chirico and Surrealists like Joan Miró, and consequently began
              using psychoanalytic methods
              of mining the subconscious to generate imagery. As he developed his own style over the next few years,
              Dalí made a number of works heavily influenced by Picasso and Miró.

            <p>
              In 1928, Dalí partnered with the filmmaker Luis Buñuel on Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog). The film's
              subject matter was so shocking
              that Dalí became infamous, causing quite a stir with the Parisian Surrealists who considered recruiting
              Dalí into their
              circle. In 1929, they sent Paul Eluard and his wife Gala to visit Dalí in Cadaques. This was the first
              time Dalí and Gala would meet and
              shortly after she divorced from Eluard. Gala, born in Russia, became Dalí's lifelong, constant, and most
              important muse, as well as
              being his future wife, his greatest passion, and his business manager.
              They married in 1934 and since their death, they lived in France, USA and Spain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dalí adapted André Breton's theory of automatism, in which an artist stifles conscious control over the
              creative process by allowing the
              unconscious mind to guide the work. Yet in the early 1930s, Dalí took this concept further by creating his
              own
              Paranoic Critical Method, in which an artist could tap into their subconscious through a self-induced
              paranoid state.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the next several years, Dalí's paintings were very illustrative of his theories about the
              psychological state of paranoia.
              Many of Dalí's most famous paintings are from this highly creative period. Also, being a skilled
              draftsman, Dalí's artistic repertoire
              also included film, sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a wide range of artists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dalí was incredibly imaginative, and also enjoyed indulging in unusual and grandiose behavior. His
              eccentric manner and attention-grabbing
              public actions sometimes drew more attention than his artwork, to the dismay of those who held his work in
              high esteem, and to the irritation
              of his critics.

              The last two decades of Dalí's life would be the most difficult and psychologically arduous, bit it was in
              1980, at age 76, that Dalí's
              health took a catastrophic turn. His right hand trembled terribly, with Parkinson-like symptoms.
              His near-senile wife allegedly had been dosing him with a dangerous cocktail of unprescribed medicine that
              damaged his nervous system,
              thus causing an untimely end to his artistic capacity. Yet, he did not waste his time : one of his most
              important achievements during
              this rough time was the creation of The Dalí Theatre-Museum in Figueres.
            </p>
            <p>
              His wife Gala died on 10 June 1982, at the age of 87. After her death in 1982, Dalí experienced a further
              bout of depression
              and is believed to have attempted suicide. On the morning of 23 January 1989, while his favorite record of
              Tristan and Isolde played,
              Dalí died of heart failure at Figueres at the age of 84. He is buried beneath the museum that he built in
              Figueres.
              His final resting place is three blocks away from the house that he was born in and across the street from
              the Sant Pere church where
              he was baptized and had his first communion.
