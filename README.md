### 6. Style
* Design & Colours
  * When planning the project, knowing that a rich visual material (photos and paintings) will be used as illustration, I wanted a simple, almost minimalist design and colour theme for the background and UI elements.
Therefore I chose a basic black and white design with simple blue (#0000ff) and red (#ff0000) highlights. I prepared the background wallpapers with Photoshop, using free png/svg images.
* Font Selection
  * The main font type was chosen with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and is used across the whole of the website: [Averia Serif Libre](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Averia+Serif+Libre). This is a well readable yet a bit dream-like font type which suits well to the theme of the site.

### 4. Bugs and Solution
Playing the video files on mobile device may be problematic, as it does not only depend on the code, but also on the settings and capacities of the device what the user uses.
Therefore, if the file could not be played on a device/browser, a Youtube link included for all videos, allowing users to watch the video in a different window if interested, without closing the actual site.
